              I began my tech journey with web development, bringing ideas to life through responsive, user-friendly websites. Over time, my curiosity led me deeper into Machine Learning, where I now explore NLP, build intelligent systems, and write research papers to push the field forward.
              <br /><br />
              Today, I'm a full-stack web developer, student researcher, and competitive programmer. I can build end-to-end products, train models, automate tedious workflows, and create conversational AI that actually works.
              <br /><br />
              Whether you're working on research, building something cool, or just need someone who gets both front-end finesse and ML depth â€” feel free to connect!
